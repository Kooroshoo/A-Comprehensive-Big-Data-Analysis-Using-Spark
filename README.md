The NY taxi commission has provided the data of their taxi for free in order to understand better how their service
works. [Link](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
They contain trips that were done by different kinds of taxi companies in the last few years.
From where they went, to where, and how much they paid, when, etc.

Our goal is to understand the different kinds of traffic that exist between the different zones.
